- 👋 Hi, I’m @amarkerr, a Computer Science student always hungry for new challenges and learning opportunities. I'm delving into the world of coding, algorithms, and software development, and I'm eager to apply my skills in real-world projects.
- 👀 I'd love to work in game development, but beyond that, my true passion is in crafting accessibility tools and features. I'm committed to developing solutions that enhance usability for everyone, making technology more inclusive and user-friendly. 
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering languages like Python, Java, and C++. My goal is to innovate in ways that bridge gaps and open new possibilities for diverse user communities.
- 🔍 I'm on a constant lookout for collaborative projects, internships, or any opportunity to grow and apply my skills. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or if you have any advice for a budding software developer!
- 📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me playing games with friends or spending time with my dogs. 🐶
